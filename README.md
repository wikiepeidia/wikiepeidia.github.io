*Nutshell of INCREMENTAL SIMULATORS*

## What are incremental simulators?

They are GAMES that mess around with:
- Multiplier
- Upgrades
- Rebirth
- Minigames

They can also be called infinite simulators that teach you how to read numbers.

## How to play

At first, 99% of games will force you to manually do something, aka:
- Click the circle
- Mining
- Click the button

Then you can buy upgrades.

The more money you get, the more you will start buying multipliers compared to +X money.

The game will start automating things, allowing you to focus on buying.

Once it becomes impossible to buy the upgrade, you would rebirth to get even more multipliers.

Most games will have different multipliers and currencies boosting each other.

## How big are the numbers?

They can be as big as 1 trillion characters.

Illustration: 1 trillion is huge, but it is nowhere near 1/1 trillion of a number that has 1 trillion characters.

## What is this game?

It is the simplest game of an incremental simulator, doing the most basic thing that exists in these games.

If Ubuntu desktop = other incremental games, then this game is equal to Linux core.

### How to play this game

Click the circle and buy upgrades.

Some upgrades stack on each other.

Buying the +0.1 multiplier would add +0.1 directly to your current amount, as well as +0.1 to the amount you would get each 50 clicks.

This game is very easy; the money's increment is not too high.

## BUG

Currently, no bugs.

However, it is easy to hack this game and more bugs WOULD appear.
