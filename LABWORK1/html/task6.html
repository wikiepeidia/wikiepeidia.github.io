        An unordered list in HTML is used to present a group of items where the order or sequence of the items is
        not
        significant. These lists are typically displayed with bullet points as markers for each item by default.
    </p>
    <h1>paragraph 2</h1>
    <p class="paragraph2">
        <style>
            .paragraph2 {
                color: red;
            }
        </style>
        In this example, "Apples," "Milk," "Bread," and "Eggs" will be displayed as a bulleted list on a web page.
        The default bullet style is a disc, but this can be customized using CSS.
    </p>
    <h1>paragraph 3</h1>
    <p class="paragraph3">
        The uL element is for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering, and their order in
        the list is meaningless.
